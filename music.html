	<h1>Music that I Like</h1>
	<h3>Professional Griefers by deadmau5 ft. Gerard Way</h3>

	<p>The above track combines the style of deadmau5 with the vocals of Gerard Way from My Chemical Romace to create a track that I regualry listen too when I need something loud to release any angst or intense feelings. I was well versed with deadmau5's music but this track was the first expose I had to anything My Chemical Romance related, allowing me to expand my tastes and see bands I wasen't interested in at first and learn to appreciate and even love listening to as well.</p>
	<h3> Thunder by Gabry Ponte x LUM!X x Prezioso

	<p>This track is a favorite of my closest friend. Coming about from the time where sea shanties became a popular genre of music due to popular use in meme culture, this song combines the whimsy of a piratey tune with electric beats to make a party track that gets stuck in my head when I feel like having fun and in high spirits.</p>
